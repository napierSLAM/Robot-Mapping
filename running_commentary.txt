At the moment most files are place holders
Over the week (26th - 1st april), the code will be built up
And all the tests and bits that are spread around are being collated and added as and when

26/3/18 16:00
So far output has been generated by the speed sensor(for distance), the magnometer(bearing) and sonar(for objects)

The speed sensor is working on an interrupt on pin 2, 
it's using milli timer to get results and reset
milli will be used for servo

16:15
Going to go back to servo and sonar
First calibrate sonar

23:30
Sonar calibrated photos taken, cone of effect, screen shots
code basic done

ISR slot counting worked out see motor code
will test tomorrow


27/3/18
10:00
Building structure of my test bot
Rather than bodging, a little more permanent bodge!
Fixing the breadboard, powershield, arduino, speed sensor to chassis
Then make superstructure at front for servo/sonar
With compass top and middle

When done can test motor code from last night (motor code currently uploaded, need to learn how to use github to be honest!)

28/3/18
Full day yesterday building test bot using my parts.
Sonar placement took a lot of time and thinking,
More on this in bit

Finished roughly 19:00, tested motor code, all good (need to cailbrate)
Then spent hours working out sonar placement. (seperate doc)

This morning rebuilt bot.
Then did testing on sonar readings
Working out the cone of effect: i.e at what distance things are seen and to what detail
Going to need a pair of sonars front and back to work properly. So 2 of 2 x sonar
Messed with code

Then wrote more for readme
Uploaded bits and pieces of code
THERE IS NOW ENOUGH CODE IN BITS AND PIECES HERE FOR SOMEONE TO PICK THROUGH AND WRITE SOMETHING

Investigated serial comms to pi
Roughed out python script and uploaded some other examples 

Looked tkinter for drawing map

29/3/18

Tkinter and python won't work for what we need
We need something that will run as a webscript

Looking into 'Processing' which seems suitable
