At the moment most files are place holders
Over the week (26th - 1st april), the code will be built up
And all the tests and bits that are spread around are being collated and added as and when

26/3/18 16:00
So far output has been generated by the speed sensor(for distance), the magnometer(bearing) and sonar(for objects)

The speed sensor is working on an interrupt on pin 2, 
it's using milli timer to get results and reset
milli will be used for servo

16:15
Going to go back to servo and sonar
First calibrate sonar

23:30
Sonar calibrated photos taken, cone of effect, screen shots
code basic done

ISR slot counting worked out see motor code
will test tomorrow


27/3/18
10:00
Building structure of my test bot
Rather than bodging, a little more permanent bodge!
Fixing the breadboard, powershield, arduino, speed sensor to chassis
Then make superstructure at front for servo/sonar
With compass top and middle

When done can test motor code frm last night
