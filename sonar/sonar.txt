Sonar placement

After experimenting with comes of effect 3 sonars are needed

3 sonars located above the bot axle set for a 32 cm obstcale give full coverage in front of the bot
and stops any blind spot

Meaning the servo doesn't need to swing for obstacle avoidance

Only need servo to decide side to turn
