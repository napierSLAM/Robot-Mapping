Putting all the development bits together into the clients bot


Each sensor is producing sane data
A good few hours were lost on the magnetometer, till I realised that the whiteboard was magnetised!

Funnily enough, for the initial combination, the magnetometer isn't going to be used. (And considering the time left may never be used).
It's all going to be on slot count.

*Slot Count*
	
Initially I need to recap all the code sections

	Check all motor functions:
	
		- forward at various speeds and for various slots
		- reverse at various speeds and for various slots
		- right for a specfic number of slots
		- left for a specfic number of slots
		- halting (? ir button lol)
				Actually quickly looking at using ir remote shows it may be a quick bolt on
		
	Then check:
	
		- number of slots for distance traveled
		- number of slots for degrees turned
