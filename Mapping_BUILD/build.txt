***Putting all the development bits together into the clients bot***


Each sensor is producing sane data
A good few hours were lost on the magnetometer, till I realised that the whiteboard was magnetised!

Funnily enough, for the initial combination, the magnetometer isn't going to be used. (And considering the time left may never be used).
It's all going to be on slot count.
Slots per turn
Slots over x 
Slots over y


*Slot Count*
	
Initially I need to recap all the code sections

	Check all motor functions:
	
		- forward at various speeds and for various slots
		- reverse at various speeds and for various slots
		- right for a specfic number of slots
		- left for a specfic number of slots
		- halting (? ir button lol)
				Actually quickly looking at using ir remote shows it may be a quick bolt on
		
	Then check:
		- interrupt slot count
		- number of slots for distance traveled
		- number of slots for degrees turned

Check Sonar Functions
Three sonar array
Side array

Serial Comms
Get and send data

All checked correct 14th april 18

Writing the code to combine all of this.
